## ðŸ“– Project Description

**Artistly.com** is a fictional performing artist booking platform built as a frontend demo using **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI**. It allows event planners to browse and filter artists, and artist managers to onboard and manage profilesâ€”all using mock data and form validation.
